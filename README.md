# PasswordManager
Password Manager with GUI made from Tkinter

This program is capable of keeping passwords from a variety of sources. The left input box will ask for what the password is for, which will be used as the ID of the password. Then, the program creates a random password based on my own personal algorithm that guarantees that it will be usable on any website. The right input box allows for password retrieval by entering the password ID such as: "Google", "Yahoo", "AOL", etc. Whatever the password was for, you will be able to find it. Stores on text document.
